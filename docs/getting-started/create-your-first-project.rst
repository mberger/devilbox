Create your first project

     This section not only applies for one project, it applied for as many projects as you need.
     **There is no limit in the number of projects.**

Step 1: visit Intranet vhost page
=================================

Before starting, have a look at the vhost page at http://localhost/vhosts.php

It should look like the screenshot below and will actually already provide the information needed to create a new project.

.. image:: /_static/img/devilbox-vhosts-empty.png


Step 2: create a project directory
==================================

In your Devilbox git directory, navigate to ``./data/www`` and create a new directory.

.. note::
     Choose the directory name wisely, as it will be part of the domain for that project.
     For this example we will use ``project-1`` as our project name.

.. code-block:: bash

   # navigate to your Devilbox git directory
   host> cd path/to devilbox

   # navigate to the data directory
   host> cd data/www

   # create a new project directory named: project-1
   host> mkdir project-1

Vist the vhost page again and see what has changed: http://localhost/vhosts.php

.. image:: /_static/img/devilbox-vhosts-directory.png

**So what has happened?**

By having created a project directory, the web server container has created a new virtual host. However it has noticed, that the actual document root directory does not yet exist and therefore it cannot serve any files yet.


Step 3: create a docroot directory
==================================

.. note::
     As desribed in :ref:`getting_started_directory_overview_docroot` the docroot directory name must be ``htdocs`` for now.

Navigate to your newly created project directory and create a directory named `htdocs` inside it.

.. code-block:: bash

   # navigate to your Devilbox git directory
   host> cd path/to devilbox

   # navigate to your above created project directory
   host> cd data/www/project-1

   # create the docroot directory
   host> mkdir htdocs

Vist the vhost page again and see what has changed: http://localhost/vhosts.php

.. image:: /_static/img/devilbox-vhosts-dns.png

**So what has happened?**

By having created the docroot directory, the web server is now able to serve your files. However it has noticed, that you have no way yet, to actually visit your project url, as no DNS record for it exists yet.

The intranet already gives you the exact string that you can simply copy into your ``/etc/hosts`` file on your host operating system to solve this issue.

.. important::
     This will only work on **native Docker** for Linux or MacOS. Read up on the next section to also find out how to do that on **Docker Toolbox** and Windows.


Step 4: create a DNS entry
==========================

.. note::
     This step can also be automated via the bundled DNS server to automatically provide catch-all
     DNS entries to your host computer, but is outside the scope of this
     *getting started tutorial*.

Add DNS for Linux and MacOS (native Docker)
-------------------------------------------

On Linux and MacOS (when using the native Docker), this step is fairly simple. The intranet provides
you the exact string you need to paste into your ``/etc/hosts`` file on your host operating system.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Open your /etc/hosts file with sudo or root privileges
    # and add the following DNS entry
    host> sudo vi /etc/hosts

    127.0.0.1 project-1.loc

Add DNS for Windows (native Docker)
-----------------------------------

On Windows (when using the native Docker), you can also copy paste the command provided by the intranet,
however the destination file is different. You have to add this string into: ``C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc``.

Open ``C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`` with admistrative privileges and add the following entry

.. code-block:: bash

    127.0.0.1 project-1.loc

Add DNS for Docker Toolbox
--------------------------

When using ``Docker Toolbox`` the Devilbox runs inside a virtual machine and therefore the Webserver port (``80``)
is not exposed to your host operating system. So your DNS record must point to the virtual machine instead of your
host system.

1. Find out the IP address the virtual machine is running on
2. Add a DNS entry to your host operating system for this IP address.

For the sake of this example, let's assume the virtual machine is running on ``192.16.0.1``, then the DNS record you will
have to add instead on your host operating system is:

**Docker Toolbox on MacOS**

.. code-block:: bash

    host> sudo vi /etc/hosts

    192.16.0.1 project-1.loc

**Docker Toolbox on Windows**

Open ``C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`` with admistrative privileges and add the following entry

.. code-block:: bash

    192.16.0.1 project-1.loc

Back to intranet
----------------

Vist the vhost page again and see what has changed: http://localhost/vhosts.php

.. image:: /_static/img/devilbox-vhosts-finished.png

**So what has happened?**

By having created the DNS record, the Devilbox intranet is aware that everything is setup now and
gives you a link to your new project.


Step 5: Visit your project
==========================

On the intranet, click on your project link. This will open your project in a new Browser tab or
visit http://project-1.loc

.. image:: /_static/img/devilbox-project-no-files.png

**So what has happened?**

Everything is setup now, however the webserver is trying to find a ``index.php`` file in your document root which does not yet exist.

So all is left for you to do is to add your HTML or PHP files.


Step 6: Create a hello world
============================

Navigate to your docroot directory within your project and create a ``index.php`` file with some output.

.. code-block:: bash

   # navigate to your Devilbox git directory
   host> cd path/to devilbox

   # navigate to your projects docroot directory
   host> cd data/www/project-1/htdocs

   # Create a hello world index.php file
   host> echo "<?php echo 'hello world';" > index.php

Alternatively create an ``index.php`` file in ``data/www/project-1/htdocs`` with the following contents:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php echo 'hello world';

Vist your project url again and see what has changed: http://project-1.loc

.. image:: /_static/img/devilbox-project-hello-world.png


Checklist
=========

1. Project directory is created
2. Docroot directory is created
3. DNS entry is added to the host operating system
4. PHP files are added to your docroot directory
